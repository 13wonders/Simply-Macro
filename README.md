# About
This is a fork of the StepMania 5 theme, Simply Love v4.8.7, that adds a game mode that attempts to simulate DDR mechanics.

# Current features:
- Selectable DDR mode at game start that enables DDR-approximate timing windows as follows (in seconds):
  - Marvelous: 0.016667,
  - Perfect: 0.033333,
  - Great: 0.091667,
  - Good: 0.141667,
  - Boo (disabled by default): 0.225000
- Judgments are renamed from ITG names to DDR names as seen above.
- "Goods" count towards combo.
- Scores earned in DDR mode are saved to a separate .xml file.

Note: Life mechanics in DDR mode have not been changed from Simply Love's ITG settings.

# Future features:
- Add DDR letter grades and money score calculation.
- Change life mechanics to better approximate DDR's life mechanics.
- Update other language files with new DDR mode strings
